The Hospitality Plugin and Shortcodes simplify creating and editing rooms, amenities and prices.

== Description ==

** Developer Focused Release ** "Out of the Box" usage may not work with many themes. Use of shortcodes is currently
the best way to use the Hospitality Plugin. Default, non-shortcode usage works well with Vantage theme from Siteorigin.com.

[Documentation for the shorcodes](http://support.guestaba.com/support/solutions/folders/5000260018 "Hospitality Plugin Docs and Support Portal")

= Shortcodes =

To maximize flexibility in layout, the plugin includes several shortcodes. Room listings can be displayed on any page of your site simply by inserting the room listing shortcode, which is **[room_listing]**. If the single
room page layout does not meet your needs, each component of the a room post--images, description, thumbnail, and rate information--can be
arbitrarily positioned and styled via their respective shortcode. 


= Custom Post Types =

The plugin creates three custom post types: Room, Amenity Sets, and Pricing Models. A Room post can represent
any lodging or meeting space that can be reserved. An Amenity Set post contains a list of standard room amenities. Pricing models manage
room rates along with their typical seasonal and other calendar-based fluctuation.

=  Amenity Sets =

Amenity Sets provide a way to create reusable lists of standard room amenities. I 

= Pricing Models =

Pricing models provide a way to create reusable price group lists for a particular room which may vary based on the seasons, holidays, and local events. 

= Rooms and Room Listings =

The room post type adds images and text to the preconfigured Amenity Sets and Pricing Models to create an individual room page. 
Multiple individual room pages are collected and displayed on the Rooms Listing page featuring a thumbnail, pricing information,
an excerpt and a link to the individual room. 

The room post template that comes with the plugin will display the room title, an image slider, the full room description, amenities, and prices. 
Three widget areas are provided on the room post page the permit display of reservation and booking forms, guest policies, maps, directions 
and other information that you want your guests to know.
